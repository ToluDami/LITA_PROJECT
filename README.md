# INTRODUCTION
This is where I documented the project I submitted while learning at Incubator Hub. This project is aimed at analysing the sales perfomance of a retail store. I explored the sales data so as to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
- Order ID
- Customer ID
- Product
- Region
- Order Date
- Quantity
- Unit Price
- Revenue
