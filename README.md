# INTRODUCTION
This is where I documented the project I submitted while learning at Incubator Hub. This project is aimed at analysing the sales perfomance of a retail store. I explored the sales data so as to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.
